							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> After reading this article I've learned that there is a reason and purpose to including white space in design. White space is 
								used to bring organization and focus to the content for a viewer. It helps keep the viewer engaged in the information they are 
								most likely looking for instead of getting overwhelmed or distracted by crowded elements on a page. I've also learned that it's
								okay to have a lot of white space as long as it is directing the viewer to the most important information. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing different examples and side by side comparisons of the Wayfair app pages between pages 
								that used white space and pages that didn't. To be honest when I looked at the " bad" examples of white space it didn't feel like anything was wrong
								until I saw the white space example. The white space example was a lot more clear and felt more "breathable" to look at.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe." </p>
						</li>
