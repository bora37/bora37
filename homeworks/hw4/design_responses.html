						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there is such a thing as color accessibility. While I've thought 
								about color in terms of visual appeal/aesthetic in design, I haven't really thought about designing
								for those with visual impairments. I've also learned that part of incorporating color accessibility design 
								is to use icons or patterns to communicate information such as errors or successes, graphs, or to differentiate
								between colors. 
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing different images and examples of What
								to do in order to incorporate color accessibility. The two most interesting examples 
								were the use of red and and exclamation point icon and the color-blind friendly mode example
								from Trello. It helps to have a visual example, and it's interesting to see that there is 
								such an option to accomodate people with color vision deficiencies.  </p>
