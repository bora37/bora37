					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> From this article I learned that dark design doesn't have anything to do with color or bad design. It is basically 
							manipulation design and something that should be avoided to be a good designer. Especially when designing with the user
							in mind, not a company. 
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was reading about the different types dark design that exists. It was interesting
							to read about them and think about what types of dark design I may have experienced whenever I go on a web page. It has also made
							me realize how often companies will use dark design. I have definitely had a lot of moments where I ended up signing up for and paying 
							for a subscription that was also frustrantingly difficult to cancel. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Good user experience design is about providing the users with seamless, enjoyable interactions with products. It has the userâ€™s best interest in mind, and is not deceptive or sneaky in nature." </p>
					</li>
