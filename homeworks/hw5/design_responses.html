                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from the article is that there is a very diverse range of how a web page can be presented or displayed, depending on the designer. 
                                Part of how a product is displayed also seems to play a role in how a web page and how the user interacts with it, is designed. There is also always some 
                                sort of noticeable motion used that might keep a user engaged with the product, such as transitioning between different produce in easygrow.io app by Edmond Vasar
                                or Selected Works Transitions Experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was just finding a resource that has a collection of UI inspiration, and is also part of a series that shows recent
                                works of UI designers(week ## series). This means that I can look at other weekly UI interaction work. It was also nice to see diverse styles in UI design and how 
                                different types of apps are designed depending on the product. I also enjoyed being able to get access to each designer behind every interface as I could use them 
                                as a source of inspriation and further explore their other works.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Out of all the different inspirations in the article, I enjoyed Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel for Norde. I liked how the selection of the color and size of the
                                shoe didn't get in the way of the image of the shoe or the description on the app. There was not need to scroll down to change the color or the shoe size, the selection 
                                was available from a swipe from the side so you could see change being made to the shoe directly. I also liked how the number for the shoe size selected would be bigger 
                                which allows the user to see what siez they have currently selected.   </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8. At first I was confused as to why there were no descriptions for each design. But then instead of just scrolling through each UI interaction, I actually tried to 
                                understand what the UI interaction page was made for and what design choices were made to fit the vibe or feel of the product. Still wished there was something to read, 
                                but other than that, it was enjoyable to look at.
