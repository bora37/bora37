        <strong><em>Cognitive Science | Sophomore</em></strong>
        <p>Hi! My name is Bora and I'm from SoCal. Compared to what seems like a lot of SoCal people I really enjoy the weather up in the Bay Area. Whenever I have 
            time I enjoy playing volleyball, baking, and learning crocheting or photography. I've also recently found that I enjoy studying in empty classrooms with 
            friends rather than libraries when I can find one. One fun fact is that I enjoy dyeing my hair and have been doing so for 7 years.
            My hair's currently blue and pink right now. </p>

        <h4>1. What is something you learned from this article?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Something I learned from this article is that I can learn to become a better designer by 
                looking at apps or products I use in everyday life, and think about why everything is placed 
                or worded the way it is. By studying a product as a user I can also try to see what the
                designer wants me to see and why.

        <h4>2. What was your favorite part of this article? </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was seeing a visual breakdown of different 
                apps and seeing the elements that make up a page. Seeing the visual breakdown 
                helped me see that there is a lot of thought that goes into designing an app, especially
                the parts that you interact with but might overlook.

        <ul>
            <li>
                "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."
            </li>
        </ul>
