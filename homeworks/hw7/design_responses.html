							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article was the importance of understanding psychology in order to create effective, functional, and visually appealing design. 
								By understanding the "why" question behind which elements to group on a page, how to group them, and where to place them, designers are able to create the best
								possible visuals that will guide a viewer in a certain direction. Out of the four ways Gestalt principles have been applied, I found "Closure" as the most interesting
								as it shows how our brain looks and tries to relate what seems like a bunch of shapes to things we have seen before, which may test our ability to create visuals using as 
								little as possible. 
							</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something interesting I found from the article was not only learning about Gestalt principles and the four key ideas that showcase it, but
								seeing how it contributes and shapes bigger scale layouts in UI design such as proximity, similarity, and common region. The way elements are grouped 
								or spaced together on a web page may not mean much when it is easy to look at but reading about these different principles and even woring on the midterm
								project showed me just how important spacing and grouping is. It has also shown me that there are different ways to group or space elements to draw focus 
								to certain parts of a page.
