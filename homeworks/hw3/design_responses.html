							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that a critical aspect of well designed layouts, products, websites, etc.,
								depend on time and research on fonts. Typography is purposeful and intentional to how an audience or viewer understands the information 
								given. The type of fonts used as well as how cohesive the fonts are with each other and the medium are important to understand when working
								on a design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the many different resources for different fonts and type of fonts to use for certain 
								platforms(like websites). It's nice to see a lot of resources in one place instead of struggling to find such resources since it's such a 
								large topic and it's hard to figure out where to begin. Some resources that I'm interested in looking into are Invision, Typ.io, and TypeWolf.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Good font pairing helps establish visual hierarchy and improve the readability of your designs."</p>
						</li>
